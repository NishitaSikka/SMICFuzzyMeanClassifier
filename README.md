Project Details:

Name: Class based simmiliarity and dissimilarity measures for fuzzy soft classifier with multiple classes of Remote Sensing Images

Where: Indian Institute Of Remote Sensing (ISRO) Dehradun

Guide: Dr. Anil Kumar (Scientist/Engineer - IIRS Dehradun)



How To:

1) Compile and run BilImage.java

2) File -> Open -> SampleImage -> Aformosat-2test -> Febformosatdatatest -> subfebformosat2

3) Classifier -> Fuzzy C-Means -> File -> Open Signature File -> Aformosat-2test -> Clay | Water | Grassland | Forest | Eucalyptus

4) Select Modified Maximum Likelihood Classifier- SID-SAM-TAN, SID-SAM-SINE

5) Classify and save

6) File -> Open -> saved image
